Alright, so you feel pretty strong in your frontend development skills, learned a framework like React, and now want build some back-end applications. You create some APIs, learn about databases, authentication, all is well.

Then you may begin to wonder &mdash; how do I connect my front-end SPA with my back-end application? Or more specifically, how does one implement authentication when you can't pass data directly into a template?

This is the question I will answer in this post, though the answer really comes down to one thing &mdash; **cookies**.

### Basic Idea
The basic idea is that if the front-end application (i.e., the browser) submits valid login credentials, the server will open a *Session* with that user and send back a signed-cookie. The server will check for this cookie when the client attempts to access protected routes. It is the job of the client to include this cookie in future HTTP requests. No cookie, no protected content.

This is why HTTPS is so important. If communication between the browser and server is not encrypted, someone could potentially intercept your cookie and use it to access your account information, which is bad.

## Preqrequisites
---
- Flask knowledge (or some backend and/or python experience)
- Knowledge of a JS framework (I'll be using React)

## Flask
---
I like Flask a lot, primarily because I like Python a lot. It also has a pretty solid community and good documentation for the major libraries. Regardless, the general ideas discussed here can be applied by developers of any stack.

Now session management is something you can attempt to do on your own, but unless you know what you're doing, it's probably best to use a library. I use the [flask-login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, which is pretty much the go to for session management in the Flask community. From the `flask-login` docs:

> Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your usersâ€™ sessions over extended periods of time.

Let's look at some of the tools that `flask-login` provides. We will break down these imports one by one.

```python
from flask_login import login_required, login_user,\
                        current_user, logout_user
```
<br />

Before we get into these methods, however, it's important to note none of this will work unless you have configured a secret-key for your app:

>   By default, Flask-Login uses sessions for authentication. This means you must set the secret key on your application, otherwise Flask will give you an error message telling you to do so.

If you are not exactly sure what all this mean, I suggest you take a look at the [Flask docs on Sessions](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#sessions).



### login__user
Let's see what this looks like in action:
 
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=request.form['username']).first()
        if user is None or not user.check_password(request.form['password']):
            return jsonify({"status":401, "msg": "Invalid username and/or password" }), 401  
        login_user(user)        
        return jsonify({
            "user": current_user.username,            
             "msg": "Logged in!" })
```
<br />

So what is *login_user* doing anyway? Well, it is creating an active session with the client who made the request.

When you log in a user using *login_user*, you are essentially saying, "Based on the credentials submitted, I trust this person and will give this person a signed-cookie to use on future requests." It is still the job of the client to include this cookie on subsequent requests, but we will cover that in a bit.

Configuring *login_user* takes a bit of work though and will not be covered here, but [here are the docs](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

### logout_user
Logging out the user is really easy:
```python
@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    logout_user()
    return jsonify({"msg": "Logged out!"})
```
<br />

It does the opposite of *login_user* in that it closes the session and doesn't give the user a cookie. Since we didn't return a cookie, the client now has nothing to give the server for auth routes. 

### login_required
This is middleware that will check for that all-important session. If the user presents a valid session, they make it through the middleware, otherwise the user is redirected with 403 .

```python
@app.route('/post/<post_id>/delete', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def delete_post(post_id):    
    if post_id is None:
        return jsonify({"msg":"You did not send me anything"})
    post = Post.query.filter_by(id=post_id).first()
    if post_id is None:
        return jsonify({"msg":"Post not found. Are you trying to break me?"}), 204
    db.session.delete(post)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"msg": "Post removed!"})
```
<br />

### current_user

When a user logs in, it's because that person is trying to access data associated with that user. Consequently, the back-end needs to know who the user is for db queries, etc. This is what *current_user* is &mdash; the user returned from the \<User> table when we log a user in.     

Consider the following code:

```python
post = Post(body=request.form['text'], author=current_user)
```
<br />

Really all that is being done here is that *current_user* is referencing the user contained in the session created with *login_user*. Python is really nice, isn't it?

## Front-end
---
The front end work comes down to one thing really, and that is including credentials when using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

```javascript
getPosts() {
    fetch('http://api.something.com/post' , {      
      credentials: 'include',
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(response => {            
      if (response.status !== 200) {
        throw(response)
      }      
      this.setState({posts: response.posts})            
      return 
    })
    .catch(e => {      
      navigate(`/err/`)
      return 
    })
  }
```

Remember how I said the only thing the client needs to do is include the cookie sent by the server &mdash; that is what we're doing we set *credentials: 'include'*. Otherwise, the client won't include the cookie since the Fetch API does not include credential by default, which is a good thing.

### Form Submission
Once a user submits a form, you're all set. Provided the logic of the form submission is sound, the back-end will provide the necessary cookies for authenticated users. I told you it was simple.

## Conclusion
---

Really this whole post can be boiled down to a few basic principles, but sometimes it's nice to have things explained. Anyway, let's review said basic principles:

- If a client submits valid username and password that client will get a cookie until the user decides to log out or the cookie expires. This cookie will be used to authenticate future requests.

- Once a user submits a valid login, all the client must do it is include the cookie provided by the server on subsequent requests.

From there, things like rerouting can be handled programmatically by the SPA. Regardless of what a potential hacker does to manipulate the front-end and access privileged pages, the perpetrator will not be able to access data without providing legitimate credentials, and that is really awesome.
