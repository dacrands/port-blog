## Long Story Short
Okay, so it's really not about React Native, because *Windows* is limiting ways beyond not being able to create iOS apps, such as the inability to run *Docker* without *Windows Pro*. That said, considering Microsoft  purchased *github,* announced the end of *Windows*, and adopted *Chromium;* their next OS will presumably be more dev friendly, so I may have jumped the gun a bit with purchasing an Apple machine, but *c'est la vie.*

Nonetheless, after spending a considerable amount of cash on a Macbook Pro, I did not have the illustrious Apple UX as expected. First, when I opened the machine, um, nothing happened. I remember buying my first MBP in 2009 and being amazed by the start-up experience. There was a picture of something from outer-space, well-designed modals, just pure brilliance. Fast forward to 2019 where my product experience consists of a quivering in my left eye, a result of fear and insecurity when I realized my new, fancy MBP was acting improperly. I was supposed to open it, it was supposed to turn on, but only 50% of the aforementioned actors did their part.

After perforimg various pressing techniques on the power button (viz., pressing, holding, and combinations thereof) the piece of brilliance finally turned on!

Now I will not drag you through the whole experience but, sadly, I had to call Apple support. I know, but Jeff or whoever the name of the individual I talked to was quite nice and I was able to set up my MBP!
