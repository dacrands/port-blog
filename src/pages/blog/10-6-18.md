I just added this super-snazzy slider to the landing page of my blog.

<video style="max-width: 100%;" autoplay  loop>

The initial css was taken from [this codepen](https://codepen.io/nickcil/pen/BygPMY), though I made some pretty significant modifications. Perhaps I will dedicate a blog post discussing how to create such a marquee, though this post will focus on how I grabbed the lovely svgs that comprise the slider.


## Open-Source SVG Logos
[This github repo](https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos) features over 1,000 svg logos from various tech organizations. I, like many creating a skills section for their portfolio, wanted to feature some of these SVGs to quickly communicate my stack to visitors. Given these SVGs are hosted on github it's not as though we can simply download the images, which would have been a tedious process anyway.

For the first logo I grabbed, I copied the raw svg code to a .txt document and saved it as an SVG &mdash; simple enough. Unfortunately, there was about ten more logos I was interested in and I was not in the mood to repeat the aforementioned process ten more times. Thankfully I know Python and this process can be easily automated.

*Note: It's recommended you use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) for this project.*

## Requests
We only need one library for this script &mdash; *requests.*

```python
import requests
``` 
<br>

Let's grab one logo so we can see what our data looks like. When we make a request, we get back a Request-object, which provides some really nice methods for webscraping. For instance, we can call *status_code* on the request to see if everything went smoothly &mdash; if the logo is there we get a status-code of *200,* if it's not we get a *404*.
```python
jsLogo = requests.get(f'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilbarbara/logos/master/logos/javascript.svg')
print(jsLogo.status_code)
>>> 200
```
<br>

Seeing that our logo exists, lets look at the text of the request, i.e., our svg.

```python
print(jsLogo.text)
```
```xml
'<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?>\n

  fill="#000000"></path>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n'
```

So we see a number of newline characters (i.e., *\n*), though I really am only concerned about the trailing one. Thankfully, this a really quick fix.

```python
cleanJsLogo = jsLogo.text.rstrip('\n')
print(cleanJsLogo)
```

The data is now ready to be written to a file.


## Writing the Data
Before we can write to a file, we need to create one. In Python, this is very trivial. We simply need to invoke Python's built-in function *open()*  and pass it two strings, the filename and the mode (e.g., write, read, etc.). We're passing *'w'* as our mode &mdash; this will create a writable file if one doesn't exist (i.e., if there isn't a file matching the passed filename). If one does exist, then it will write over the existing content of that file. [Click here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) for more information on Python's *open()* function.

Once we create the file, writing to it is just a matter of passing our text to the file-object and then closing the file-object.

```python
jsSvg = open('js-logo.svg', 'w')
jSsvg.write(cleanJsLogo)
jSsvg.close()
```
<br>

And that's pretty much it. Now lets put the pieces together and grab our logos.

## Putting It All Together
I didn't want all 1,000 logos, I only needed a few. Thus, I simply hardcoded a list of the logos I wanted. If you wanted all 1,000 you can import the *BeautifulSoup* library, access the list of logos, iterate through that list, etc., but I won't cover that here.

```python
logoList = ["flask", "css-3", "html-5", "react", "sass", "redux", "nodejs", "heroku", "postman", "webpack", "python"]
```

<br>

Once we have our list, it's just a matter of applying the logic from earlier.

```python
for logo in logoList:
    logoReq = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilbarbara/logos/master/logos/{0}.svg".format(logo))
    if logoReq.status_code == 200:
        logoSvg = open("{0}-logo.svg".format(logo), "w")
        logoSvg.write(logoReq.text.rstrip("\n"))
        logoSvg.close()
```

<br>

Note we don't need exception handling. If the request does not return a status-code  of *200,* the logo doesn't exist, so we only need logic for successful requests.

And that's about it. Once you run this script, it will populate your current directory with the requested svg files.
